# JavaFX Battleship Game

<p align="center">
This is a network based Battleship implementation utilizing the JavaFX GUI framework. The initial commit of this project was the original source code written while I was in college where a class partner and I made this program for a class project. I plan on refactoring and updating the code base in time.

Instructions to run the game as well as configuring JavaFX will be provided some time in the future. Currently the game runs directly out of an IDE with the JavaFX library attached to the project as a user library
